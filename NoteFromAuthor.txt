Salutations!

I'm just a student from Olympic College who is learning Project Management in the context of Information Systems.
As part of my project, I took 100 questions from a couple of your videos and threw them into a database, which you should see under the public folder of this GitHub repository.
I have added the CSV, JSON, and Excel files because as it is now, the fetch code is currently pulling from a temporary IP Address using Amazon Web Services (AWS),
which may have already expired by the time this reaches you. So, if you have a tech-savvy friend who can fix this up for you, send this their way.

Things to also note is that I'm not quite sure of the image in the background is under copyright, so please change it to your liking.

Anyway, hope this helps you and your community!

Very respectfully,
Randall
