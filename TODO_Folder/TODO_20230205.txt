Ideas:

- Figure out randomizer.
- Figure out flip animation on click.
- Percentage calculation out of X amount of questions.
- If a question has been answered, don't ask again from array.
- Check mark, X mark, ? mark.
  - Anything marked with ? mark throws question back into a separate array to pull from later.
  - A check to see if anything is in the ? queue.
    - If there is something in the ? queue, pull question from ? queue.
    - If there is nothing in the ? queue, do percentage calc.
  - Use "chip" for React code.
    - OnClick does a fill.
      - OnClick "spawns" a confirm button.
