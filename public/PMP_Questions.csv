Projects are run by people, products are developed by people for people to use and our interactions either make or break a project."
2,"The executive management in your organization has assembled a new team, and dictated that they will use Agile for their product development. As the project progresses, there is confusion about the product scope and the definition of what done looks like. As an Agile Project Manager, what will you recommend to the executive team?","Select a person from each part of the organization to assist, to ensure diversity.",Have the functional manager select their friends or favorite team member.,"Encourage a self-organizing team to form, including the people who asked for the requirements and outcomes in the first place.",Hire external consultants to run the project and create the product.,"Encourage a self-organizing team to form, including the people who asked for the requirements and outcomes in the first place.","Agile encourages self-organizing teams composed of the people who created the requirements and had the desired outcome in the first place. This gives a higher level of ownership and product expertise, that often cannot be bought."
3,You are running an Agile project and meet with the team for the next sprint planning meeting. What will you do next?,Negotiate the scope and costs of the project with the project sponsor.,Walk through three questions with the team--what did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Is anything blocking me?,"The dev team demonstrates the working feature to the product owner, who marks it complete.","The product owner shares the updated backlog, and the team discusses it to ensure a shared understanding.","The product owner shares the updated backlog, and the team discusses it to ensure a shared understanding.",The product owner should share the updated backlog items and ensure the entire team has a good understanding of how to move forward.
4,You are a project manager working on an Agile project and want your team to maximize the value they bring to the customer. What can you eliminate in order to maximize project value?,Daily stand-ups.,Unnecessary features.,Sprint reviews.,Testing.,Unnecessary features.,"In addition to eliminating the introduction of unnecessary features, value can be maximized by eliminating partially done work, delays, extra processes and features, task switching, waiting, moving information or a deliverable, defects or rework, and handoffs."
5,You are working on a project and the team have recently moved to an Agile way of work. One of the team members is confused about Scrum and what typically happens after the sprint review. What will you tell them happens next?,Hold a sprint retrospective with the team.,Perform product backlog refinement with the product owner.,"Perform story card elaboration with the three amigos (Business, Development, Testing).",Hold a Daily Scrum.,Hold a sprint retrospective with the team.,"A sprint retrospective is held with the Whole Team, after a sprint review, but before the sprint planning meeting. We use it to gather lessons learned and look for opportunities for improvement, and everyone has a voice for feedback and to implement improvements before the next sprint."
6,You are working in an Agile team and preparing the Agile team charter. You work with the Agile team to ensure the team charter answers these four questions: Why are we doing the project? Who benefits and how?,When will the project end? What do we do with the product?,"What does ""done"" mean for the project? How are we going to work together?",How much risk is on the project? What is the project scope?,How many defects are allowed in the product? How many testers are there?,"What does ""done"" mean for the project? How are we going to work together?","An Agile team charter typically covers why we are doing the project, who benefits and how, what does done look like, and how are we going to work together. (See Agile Practice Guide, Ch 5, p.49)"
7,You are working with a new Agile project manager and explain that Agile favors value-based measurements instead of predictive measurements on a project. What is an example of value-based measurements?,Earned value management and the schedule performance index.,Variance Analysis and the Estimate to Complete.,Feature burndown chart (features delivered) and customer satisfaction.,Variance at Completion and the cost performance index.,Feature burndown chart (features delivered) and customer satisfaction.,Agile works with value delivered as its primary measurement. All the other options are predictive measurements from a traditional project management methodology.
8,"Agile Unified Process (AUP) is an Auxiliary Agile method that focuses on performing more iterative cycles across seven key disciplines, and incorporating the associated feedback before formal delivery. Which is NOT one of the seven key disciplines within a release?",Discipline of the high level model.,Discipline in managing stakeholders' expectations.,Discipline in testing.,Discipline in configuration management.,Discipline in managing stakeholders' expectations.,"Agile focuses on transparency to ensure the customer needs are met, not in specifically managing customer expectations."

Which of the following is NOT one of its core beliefs?",Technologies change techniques.,People change functions.,Cultures change norms.,Distances change communication.,People change functions.,"Crystal Clear describes the three core beliefs as Technologies changing techniques, cultures changing norms, and distances changing communication - all reasons behind the core practices of Agile such as stand-ups, collaborative user story, creation, retrospectives and the whole team approach."
11,"You are working on a project in the role of Scrum Master, and have set a meeting with the team and the product owner to refine the product abcklog. What should the team do in this meeting?",Estimate and refine the work items.,Prioritize the work items.,Add features to the project backlog.,Identify fixes.,Estimate and refine the work items.,The product owner adjusts the priority of product backlog items. The team is responsible for estimating and refining work items. Each time the team refines their estimates with a higher level of detail.
12,You are working with a team who would like to become Agile. The function manager asks you what the difference between Kanban and Scrum is. What will you tell them?,Kanban teams plan with work in sprints or iterations.,There are no WIP limits in Kanban.,Kanban teams work on a project as a whole.,Kanban teams employ a pull system.,Kanban teams employ a pull system.,"The main difference between Scrum and Kanban is that Kanban teams employ a pull system. This means when an item of work is completed, it triggers someone to ""pull"" the next item in the queue onto the board to work on. Kanban teams work off a Kanban board that displays each task, and have a limit to how much work in progress (WIP) can be in place."
13,"You are working on a new project with an Agile product development team, who have self-formed and chosen a Scrum Master called Jeremy. Jeremy immediately sets a meeting with the team to explain and flesh out their Team Charter. What has made Jeremy a good choice for Scrum Master?",He likes to work within set processes.,He has been with the company for more than five years.,He knows servant leadership and engages the team in decisions.,He sticks to the plan and does not change.,He knows servant leadership and engages the team in decisions.,"Jeremy shows the traits of servant leadership by engaging the team in team decisions, starting with the Team Charter and ground rules so everyone knows where they stand. By communicating the reasons for his decisions, he is a suitable Scrum Master and will be less focused on command and control."
14,You are managing a project as an Agile project manager and a business representative for the product you are delivering asks you how many defects were found in the latest round of testing. You don't know the answer. What should you do?,Guess the number then change the subject.,Tell the business partner you will send an e-mail to him with the information.,"Take him into the team area, where the ""information radiator"" with project information is displayed.",Ask the business partner to call the Scrum Master to get a correct answer.,"Take him into the team area, where the ""information radiator"" with project information is displayed.","A core component of Agile is Visual Management and transparency. Part of this are the various parts of the project information radiator (often physical, but can be tech-driven). This includes things such as the team velocity, Kanban board, the product backlog, the burndown chart, the latest test results and issues, and results of retrospectives."
15,You are working in a company that is moving from a Waterfall methodology to Agile. You mention to the business unit manager that the team will be better prepared to respond to change and meet the customer needs. Why is this?,The Agile team works directly with a business owner or representative to constantly prioritize delivered value.,The Agile team delivers the product all in one go.,"The Agile team is for developers only, so development will improve.",The business partners review statuses and ask for recommendations.,The Agile team works directly with a business owner or representative to constantly prioritize delivered value.,"Working with business partners or someone who reperesents the customer almost daily is a key part of Agile. The team hears what the business would like the results to be, and meeting face-to-face is better than reading requirements, documents, e-mails, or even a conference call."
16,"For Agile life-cycles, two kinds of planning occur, release planning and iteration planning. In release planning, business representatives establish and prioritize the user stories for the release, in collaboration with the team, refining larger user stories into a collection of smaller stories. What is the INCORRECT description below regarding iteration planning and backlog preparation?","The backlog is the ordered list of all the work, present in ""story"" form, for a team.","The project coach encourages the team to work alone, so no one bothers them.","The facilitator encourages the team to work in triads of a developer, tester, and product owner/business analyst.","The triad discus, write, and then place enough stories into an iteration, and enough features for a first release.","The project coach encourages the team to work alone, so no one bothers them.","Answers A, C, and D are correct in describing Backlog Preparation for Iteration Planning."
17,Behaviour-driven development (BDD) allows a developer to focus on testing the code based on the expected behaviour of the software and is a method of writing user stories. What is the correct description regarding BDD acceptance-based criteria?,"Make, Buy, Do.","Tell, Show, Repeat.","Find, Create, Perform.","Given, When, Then.","Given, When, Then.","Given, When, Then is the way BDD is used, particularly when outlining user Story Cards for your iteration. It highlights ""Given"" a certain situation, ""When"" something happens, ""Then"" we want this to happen."
18,"Every project has characteristics around requirements, delivery, change and goals. Understanding the different types of life cycle, you can choose the right one for the circumstatnces of your project. What is the correct description for a ""Waterfall"" approach?","Predictive - Fix requirements, performed once for the entire project, in a single delivery.","Predictive - Fixed requirements, performed multiple times for the entire project, in multiple deliveries.","Predictive - Variable requirements, performed once for the entire project in a single delivery.","Predictive - Variable requirements, performed multiple times for the entire project, in multiple deliveries.","Predictive - Fix requirements, performed once for the entire project, in a single delivery.",A Predictive or Waterfall project management lifecycle focuses on fixed requirements performed once for the project for a single delivery.
19,"Every project has characteristics around requirements, delivery, change and goals. Understand the different types of life cycles will allow you to choose the right one for the circumstances of your project. What is the correct description for an ""Iterative"" project approach?","Dynamic requirements, repeated until correct, in multiple deliveries.","Dynamic requirements, repeated until correct, in a single delivery.","Fixed requirements, repeated until incorrect, in a single delivery.","Fixed requirements, performed once for a given increment, in a single delivery.","Dynamic requirements, repeated until correct, in a single delivery.","Iterative methods have dynamic requirements, repeated with feedback until they are correct, but delivered only once."

Which of the following is NOT one of the core properties of Kanban?",Visualize the workflow and limit work in progress.,"Manage Flow and Enable ""Pull"".",Implement feedback loops and improve collaboratively.,Follow procedures and don't deviate from the plan.,Follow procedures and don't deviate from the plan.,"Kanban is a method borrowed from the Toyota Production System, or Lean. It focuses on limiting the work in progress so work is focused, ensuring feedback loops are in place, and making the work visible so blockages are clear."
21,"A Team Charter is also a ""social contract"". Which of the below is NOT usually a part of an Agile Team Charter?","Team values, such as sustainable pace and core hours.","Working agreements, such as what ""ready"" means so the team can take in work, and what ""done"" means so the team can judge completeness consistently.","Ground rules, such as one person talking in a meeting.",Schedule performance index and cost performance indext for the project.,Schedule performance index and cost performance indext for the project.,"The Agile Team Charter focuses on the vision (the ""Why"") and the team way of work. SPI and CPI are earned value management metriccs from a predictive project methodology, and not part of an Agile Team Charter."
22,You are working with a team that is new to Agile and are using Scrum to manage the project. The business representative is confused about the difference between a sprint review and a sprint retrospective. What will you tell them?,Sprint review demonstrate the work completed in the sprint.

What is the overall first questions that you should ask and use as a guide for your work?",How long will the project last?,What is the business value?,How much is the budget?,How many team members will participate?,What is the business value?,"Agile projects centre around delivering business value, and working closely with the customers and business representatives to ensure that the value is always correct. Business risk and the impact of not understaing the project must also be considered."
24,The Agile team for which you are the project manager has determined several key features to deliver to the customer. How should these tasks be tackled by the team?,"The features should be priotized, tested, and delivered incrementally.","The features should be delivered quickly, whether or not they are complete, to gather feedback.",The features should be delivered according to the project plan.,All features should be delivered at the end of the project.,"The features should be priotized, tested, and delivered incrementally.","Agile is a combination of Incremental delivery and Iterative development. That means business value is continuously and iteratively improved and prioritized, while also being delivered in increments that the customer can see, feel, and touch. The features should be complete tested, and quality is everyone's responsibility."
25,"You are working on an Agile project and the project team have just finished an iteration. All tasks for the iteration have been completed, and you are ready to move to the next iteration, but are not sure what the team should work on. What will you do next?",Follow the project plan developed early in the project.,"Follow the PMO, who has already determined how the project should progress.","Ask the product owner, who continuously prioritizes the backlog.",Ask the project coach or team leader to determine the next iteration.,"Ask the product owner, who continuously prioritizes the backlog.","The product owner represents the customer, who you are delivering business value to. The team works through the list of items that have identifiable value and have been prioritized by the customer."
26,"While meeting with the customers or business owners, they introduce several pieces of new functionality into the product backlog list. The deadline for the product cannot be changed. What will you do next?",Tell the team to work overtime in order to deliver the project.,Stand by your team and tell the customers the project will not be delivered on time.,Be sure the customers understand that lower priority features may drop off the project completely.,Agree with the customers to have all new items put into a separate category that will be completed if time allows.,Be sure the customers understand that lower priority features may drop off the project completely.,"An Agile project can accept changes even late in development. But while the competing constraints of cost, quality and schedule are often fixed, in Agile the scope can vary. This means some features may need to drop off, as others become prioritized. A maintainable pace of work is required too - the project managers must not overwork the project team to increase the pace of the project work."
27,"Every project has characteristics around requirements, delivery, change and goals. Understanding the different types of life cycle will allow you to choose the right one for the circumstances of your project. What is the correct description for an ""Incremental"" project management approach?","Fixed requirements, activities performed once, in multiple deliveries.","Dynamic requirements, activities repeated until correct, in one large delivery.","Dynamic requirements, performed once for a given increment, in frequent smaller deliveries.","Fixed requirements, performed once for a given increment, in frequent smaller deliveries.","Dynamic requirements, performed once for a given increment, in frequent smaller deliveries.","Incremental project management approach includes dynamic requirements, performed once for a given increment, with frequent smaller deliveries."

Autocratic leadership typically is a one person affair, while servant leadership builds psychological safety for the whole team to engage and contribue. All other items listed are Agile core practices."
29,"Poor specifications are often a major reason for project failure. In Agile development, user stories are written with the developers, testers, and business representatives, with frequent reviews to ensure they are right. Which of the following is NOT correct regarding Collaborative User Story Creation?",A user story addresses both function and non-function requirements.,The project sponsor must sign off on all user stories in advance.,A user story includes acceptance criteria for the feature to be developed.,"Characteristics for acceptance criteria must be: Estimatable, Small, and Testable.",The project sponsor must sign off on all user stories in advance.,"While it is common for the developers, testers, and business representatives to agree on the story card criteria, it is not signed off by the project sponsor directly. The product owner, representing the business and/or the customer, grooms the feature backlog work so they always know that business value is being delivered."
30,"In Continuous Integration: configuration management, compilation, software build, deployment, and testing are wrapped into a single, automated, repeatable process. Defects in code are:","not an issue during continuous integration, making it an ideal Agile method.","detected more quickly because they constantly integrate their work, build and test.",integrated into their work during this phase as part of Test Driven Development.,"collected and fixed in an iteration at the end of the project, to avoid delay.","detected more quickly because they constantly integrate their work, build and test.","Continuous Integration merges code to a test environment using an automated process, including automated regression tests to ensure nothing is broken. This allows the team to find and fix defects in the code more quickly. Test Driven Development writes a test first (which fails at first), then the code to ensure the test passes."
31,Agile has certain core practices that are used within any team working in an Agile way. Which of the following is NOT a core practice of Agile?,"The whole team approach, where any person needed is brought into the project team.","Early and frequent feedback, to ensure a common understanding of the product.","Daily stand-ups, to report on progress and raise blockers.","Reporting to executives, to ensure they are happy with your project.","Reporting to executives, to ensure they are happy with your project.","While reporting to executives has its place when running a project, in Agile it would rather be done by including them in other Agile core practices, such as demonstrations or reviews of the product, showing the product burndown chart in the team area, and the backlog of work. All other items are Agile core practices."
32,"You are working on a project as an Agile project manager. You look at the product backlog and ensure several features, or minimum viable products (MVPs) can be scheduled for delivery throughout the duration of the project. Why is this a good idea?",To show executives that progress is being made by the development team.,To keep the project duration short.,"To enable users to test the product for quality, and give feedback.","To enable the business to get value quickly, as features are delivered.","To enable the business to get value quickly, as features are delivered.","Minimum Viable Products are usable features in their own right that are delivered incrementally. This allows for business value to be gained more quickly, while gathering feedback on the use of these features."
33,"You are working on a complex software project but see that the team uses a whiteboard, and writes tasks on cards or sticky notes. The business representative seems put off by the use of these low-tech tools on such a high profile technology project. What will you tell them?",The team are using low-tech tools so low-tech people can understand them.,"A whiteboard is actually a complex thing, they just don't know it yet.","The team is using the principle of visual management, and by using a physical board it is transparent to anyone who needs the information.",The team will drop everything and develop a new software-based Kanban board to avoid embarrassment.,"The team is using the principle of visual management, and by using a physical board it is transparent to anyone who needs the information.","Visual Management is a Lean principle borrowed into Agile, where we make key pieces of information as accessible as possible. Often found in the team area and often physical, it means anyone can walk through the area and see what they need at a glance. Kanban is an example of a low-tech/high-touch tool."
34,Agile teams practice frequent verification and validation during and at the end of each iteration through demonstrations and reviews. Which one of the following is NOT a benefit of this method?,It enables the team to catch mistakes and mismatched customer expectations early.,It keeps everyone busy and gives them something to do.,It is easy to manage since there are multiple feedback loops.,It reduces cost overruns as mistakes are found early prior to additional tasks being built upon a faulty foundation.,It keeps everyone busy and gives them something to do.,"Busy-work does not add value to the project, and is not a benefit of Agile."
35,You are on an Agile software implementation project with a very short deadline. How do Agile teams shorten the time between identifying a defect and resolving the defect?,Continuous integration.,Daily build and smoke tests.,Usability testing.,Exploratory testing.,Continuous integration.,"Continuous Integration aims to merge code and have a working build once a day, then executes automated tests quickly to see if anything is broken. This frequent checking ensures less time passes before a problem is identified."

38,"Continuous Integration wraps software build, development, and testing into a single, automated, repeatable process. This merges all changes made to the software and:",separates each feature into its own development pool.,"ensures no code is changed, to avoid complication.","integrates all changed components regularly, at least once a day.",enables new features for the product backlog.,"integrates all changed components regularly, at least once a day.","Continuous integration is designed to merge all changes made to the software and test them automatically, discovering any defects or issues on a daily basis."
39,Crystal is one of the original frameworks that contributed to Agile. It is designed to scale and realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of practices based on size and complexity. Its core values include:,"People, Interaction, and Community.","Finding people, building people, leading people.","Building products, buying products, selling products.","Profit, Persistence, and Power.","People, Interaction, and Community.","Crystal's core values include People, Interaction, and Community - in the same way as Agile is based around iterations over processes and tools - and understanding the impact things have on way of work and getting things done."
40,Crystal is designed to scale and realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of practices based on size and complexity. What are some of the ways that Crystal scales?,"Crystal blue, indigo and violet, based on number of features in the backlog.","Crystal clear, yellow or red, based on number of people involved.","Crystal metal, wood and water, based on the flow of story cards through the Kanban board.","Crystal High, Low, and Medium, based on dollars spent on the project.","Crystal clear, yellow or red, based on number of people involved.","Crystal clear, yellow, orange and red are based on factors such as people involved (0 to 8, all the way up to 100 or more), money involved and the general comfort level of the project."
41,"You are working through and Agile project with your team, meeting daily in a daily stand-up. What is NOT one of the reasons Agile teams use daily stand-ups?",To micro commit to the team.,To uncover and remove blockers.,To ensure work flows freely through the team.,To report to the executive team.,To report to the executive team.,"Stand-ups are used to the micro-commit to each other, uncover blockers, and ensure work flows freely through the team. While everyone (including an executive) is welcome to join the stand-ups, they are not specifically for reporting to an executive team."
42,You are the project manager on an Agile project that is half way through. The project sponsor is starting to raise concerns that the project will not be completed in the allotted time. What will you do to gather the information necessary to answer the project sponsor?,Review the Kanban board and the current WIP.,Check the product backlog for remaining features.,"Review the team velocity, product burndown chart and other key performance indicators.",Have a team meeting and log everyone's status.,"Review the team velocity, product burndown chart and other key performance indicators.","Agile Key Performance Indicators include team velocity (rate of progress) and remaining work. These can be shown visually as well, such as on a burndown chart. Reviewing these KPIs will give you the most reliable answer."
43,You are attending the kick-ff meeting with the Agile team and the business owners. The Scrum Master recommends using MoSCow to help prioritize the work with the product/business owners. How does MoSCoW prioritize the product backlog?,"Using Priority 1, Priority 2, Priority 3, Priority 4.","Using Low, Medium, High.","Using must have, should have, could have, will not have.",Using multiple dots that people can assign to the features they like.,"Using must have, should have, could have, will not have.","The MoSCoW method of prioritization labels tasks as must have, should have, could have, and will not have (or would like to have). Other prioritization techniques are multi-voting with dots, monopoly money, Kano analysis, and fist of five."
44,Agile teams use different methods to manage work in progress (WIP). The business sponsor believes that removing the limits to work in progress will help the team take on more work and get their product delivered faster. What will you tell them?,You will remove the limits and push as much work through as possible.,You will dictate overtime and no holidays for the team to get things done.,"WIP Limits ensure the team focuses on one main thing at a time, and avoids the time cost of switching tasks.","WIP can be seen on the Kanban board, so it doesn't matter what the limit is.","WIP Limits ensure the team focuses on one main thing at a time, and avoids the time cost of switching tasks.","In Agile, work is taken on based on the team velocity or rate of work. The Kanban board shows the WIP and who is working on what. Knowing the velocity allows you to ensure enough work is taken on, but not too much. Research has proven that multitasking or switching tasks actually reduces effectiveness as the team gets up to speed again."
45,"You are on an Agile team that includes many stakeholders who have not worked with an Agile project in the past. Several stakeholders have some valid concerns about some Agile methods. As a servant leader or project coach, what will you do to make them more comfortable with the process?","Educate stakeholders, address their concerns, and keep them engaged.","Tell them it has worked in the past, it will work here too.",Dictate to the stakeholders that this is how all future projects must be executed.,Go back to a Waterfall style project management method.,"Educate stakeholders, address their concerns, and keep them engaged.","A servant leader includes the team in decisions, and grows the team through education and coaching."

It allows changes to be raised early. Quality is everyone's responsibility on an Agile team."
47,"Teams use daily stand-ups to micro-commit to each other, uncover and remove blockers, and ensure work flows smoothly through the team. What is NOT true about stand-ups?",They are often time-boxed to 15 minutes.,The team walks through the Kanban or task board.,The team facilitator or anyon in the team can facilitate.,Only people in the project team can attend.,Only people in the project team can attend.,"Agile teams are open and transparent, and encourages stakeholders to ""pull"" information or work when needed. Anyone can attend, to learn, watch or contribute. Stand-ups are time-boxed to 15 minutes, the team walks through the Kanban board, and anyone in the team can facilitate."
48,"Features are completed in an Agile project, usually in the form of multiple user stories. When a feature is complete, the team periodically demonstrates the working product to the customer, business representative and/or the product owner. These demonstrations or reviews:","only occur at the end of the project, or when stakeholders are available.","often occur at the end of an iteration, or when enough features have been ocmpleted into a set that is coherent.",often occur at the start of the project so everyone knows what they have to deliver.,"often occur when the team wants to, as they are so busy working anyway.","often occur at the end of an iteration, or when enough features have been ocmpleted into a set that is coherent.","Agile ""sprint reviews"", or feature demonstrations, occur at the end of an iteration or when enough cards or features have been completed into a set that can be showcased."

Risk threshold is the measure of acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk appetite. In this scenario a 10% variation around $2m is $1.8m to $2.2m.
62,"A risk has been raised in your project around insufficient building material. One risk response assigned to the functional manager suggests to use a brand new material, which has not been fully tested in a building project. Half of your stakeholder group are happy with this risk response, but the other half are not, and refuse to sign off on it. What will you do next?",Suggest a quantitative risk approach to give a more accurate financial impact.,"Suggest they proceed with the proposed risk response, and ensure it is followed through.","Suggest a different risk owner, as an executive may have more power to respond to the risk.","Suggest a different risk response, as they should be timely, cost effective, realistic, and agreed to by relevant stakeholders.","Suggest a different risk response, as they should be timely, cost effective, realistic, and agreed to by relevant stakeholders.","This question refers to risk responses.

The lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range in values. Precision is different from accuracy, as it refers to the exactness of the estimate, for example, ""2 days"" is more precise than ""sometime this week""."
86,"You are working on a business case where you know that the industry is undergoing a significant change at the moment, and there could be many different impact to your project benefits before it is delivered completely. The project sponsor asks you for the best estimate of benefits you can give under the circumstances.

If the estimate is uncertain, this is the best approach. Deterministic is a number, absolute is specific, actual numbers and relative estimates are shown in comparison to other estimates."
87,"You have noted nine epics for delivery as part of your most recent project. Your team have broken down these epics into user stories, and would like to see the effort involved for these deliverables. You ask your team to find the smallest user story, size it with a ""1"", and then determine the size of the other cards based on how they compare to the original card.

A high level release plan is developed that indicates basic features and functionalitity to be included in each release.
94,"You are working in a project team that has recently moved to an Agile way of work. Your business analysts want to gather the requirements, solutions, match them to the scope and do a work breakdown structure (WBS) for the whole deliverable. Your product owner says this will take too long, and is not Agile enough for their needs. What will you do next?",Ask your team to review the scope management plan for the proper process.,Break the deliverable down into smaller pieces so you can deliver those faster.,"Ask your team to timebox work on the highest priority items in the backlog, update the estimates then reprioritize as necessary.","Review the project charter for the high level scope, and use this to begin delivery quickly.","Ask your team to timebox work on the highest priority items in the backlog, update the estimates then reprioritize as necessary.","Adaptive approaches often use timeboxes. The work is based on a prioritized backlog. The project team determines the amount of work they can do in each timebox, estimates the work and self-manages to accomplish the work. At this point, the backlog may be reprioritized for the next timebox."
