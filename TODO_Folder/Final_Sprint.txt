Final sprint for IS450

- Figure out how to center the card for ALL resolutions.
  - Spacing is weird on my second monitor vs main monitor.
  - <center> centers everything, not just card position.
- Add an explanation at the top of the page.
- Make it more aesthetically pleasing.
  - Different background?
  - Sound?
  - Change button color?
  - Shadow to the card?

If I have time:
- Add separate "unsure" and "wrong" queue/array.
